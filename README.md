 We have succeeded in creating a dataframe that is very easy to visualize in order to better understand and appropriate it
 Then we go from a dataframe that is not cleaned like this one:

Has a dataframe that is perfectly readable to analyze the information it contains:

So we manage to create a world map that lists the cases of use of drugs

We were able to create visualizations such as a graph taking into account the age, alcohol consumption and gender of individuals:

We also compared the parameter of education and ethnicity of the cases with their alcohol consumption:

## Legal Drug Use
### Vizualisations

Here are the most interesting visualizations of the legal drugs that we will analyze next:

### Conclusions 

Alcohol use showed a slight positive correlation with education level, such that higher education was associated with more frequent drinking. Specifically, those with a university degree or higher (i.e., master's or doctorate) drank the most alcohol. In addition, frequent drinkers tended to have higher impulsive sensation seeking (SS) scores, such that a majority of non-drinkers (never drank or drank more than a decade ago) had an SS score close to -1.0 while frequent drinkers (drank one week or one day ago) tended to have a score between 0 and 0.25.

Unlike alcohol, nicotine showed a marked difference in consumption between the sexes, with men consuming more nicotine than women. In addition, nicotine use was positively correlated with both the BIS-11 impulsivity score and SS. However, this relationship was slightly more pronounced in SS.

We examined the relationship between Benzodiazepine and various personality measures. Benzodiazepine use frequency showed a positive correlation with neuroticism (Nscore), impulsivity and SS scores. This correlation was strongest in the Nscores. These results align with other research that has suggested a relationship between benzodiazepine sensitivity and neuroticism with those with higher neuroticism showing higher sensitivity to Benzos 

Interestingly, there was a strong negative correlation between Nscore and Conscientiousness (Cscore). To better understand how this relationship was related to drug use, we examined nicotine and benzo use. Not surprisingly, those who used both nicotine and benzo tended to have higher Nscores and lower Cscores, while those who used no drugs had high Cscores and low Nscores
